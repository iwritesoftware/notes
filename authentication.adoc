= Authentication
At some point you will need to allow users to have accounts. When a user logs into their account they first need to **authenticate** that they are who they claim.

It is possible (and easier) to side-step the whole authentication work by using third-parties accounts and letting them handle it. Some commonly used third-parties you can use for 
authentication include Google, Facebook, Github, and Twitter. Authentication through them is done using the oauth protocol. Luckily there are libraries 
that handle the logic for us and all we need to do is use them.

== OAuth

=== Overview
More information about oauth at http://oauth.net/

=== Github
We'll use Github's account system and oauth instead of rolling our own at least to start with. 

== Rolling your own
If rolling your own authentication this page contains useful information - https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Authentication_Cheat_Sheet.
